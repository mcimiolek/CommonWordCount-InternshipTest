Coding Test - GitPrime Internship
Matthew Imiolek


Here is my submission for the coding test which asked for me to remove the 1000 most common words, and then take the remaining word counts from Alice in Wonderland.

Things to note:
1) In order to run properly, the text file with the common words must be the first input, and the text file you want the remaining words to be counted in must be second.
2) There is no default file names, so the file names to be used need to be given as arguments
3) I have provided text files with the list of most common words, and with Alice in Wonderland. They are respectively called common.txt and alice.txt
4) I originally wrote my code using IntelliJ, so there are more files related to this project, but I have only provided what was needed to run this on Window's Command Prompt
5) I have left both the .class and .java files in this submission
